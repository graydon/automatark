# Regular expressions

The regexlib-clean regular expressions are taken from (regexlib.com/)[http://www.regexlib.com]. 
We filtered those that did not compile in Java and those that only contained alphabetic characters (i.e., they only matched a given word).

## Input format
Some regular expressions contain non-regular operators such as backreferences and lookaheads.
