VM setting: Ubuntu 16.04 (64bit), 4G RAM. User name and password are the same: automatark
Host setting: macOS, i7 2.6GHz 4 cores CPU, 16 GB RAM



HOW TO:
after booting the image
 
path of all benchmarks and code: /Documents/automatark
You can click the "Files" icon on the left panel, then click "Documents" on the left and visit automatark folder directly.

To run the programs, click the last icon on the left panel (Eclipse icon).
After starting Eclipse, the code is in the package named Parsers.
The parsers and the unit tests are inside Parsers/src folder.
Inside Parser/testBenchmarks folder, we provide two tests:
TestAllBenchmarks which calls the parsers and removes duplicate benchmarks,
CountBenchmarkStates which calculates the average number of states for each category of our benchmarks.
Click the green start button on the top of the options for running program in Eclipse.

Due to the difference in VM environment and host environment, we deleted one file in tree-automata that can be run in host but has memory issue in VM.
